hello my name is Andrew Van Slaars
and this is a quick walkthrough of how

0:00:04.130,0:00:10.719
to configure riot js to work with
webpack. If you're not familiar with riot js

0:00:10.719,0:00:15.980
you might want to check out my
previous videos to get you started.

0:00:15.980,0:00:17.220
in this video

0:00:17.220,0:00:20.460
we're going to cover getting webpack
and the dependencies we will be using

0:00:20.460,0:00:27.619
installed via MPN setting up the web a
configuration file process are tagged in

0:00:27.619,0:00:33.520
javascript files and serving a page with
our bundled assets through webpack's

0:00:33.520,0:00:38.430
development server. let's get our
environment setup. I've created an empty

0:00:38.430,0:00:42.469
directory for this project and I have
both atom and terminal window pointed to

0:00:42.469,0:00:47.879
that directory so let's get started.
because we're going to be using NPM

0:00:47.879,0:00:53.960
modules we're going to start with an MPN in
it and we're going to pass at the white

0:00:53.960,0:00:57.629
flag so it takes the default so we don't
have to press enter for each one

0:00:58.730,0:01:11.610
and now I'm gonna NPM install webpack
passing it perceived flag now that we're

0:01:11.610,0:01:19.160
packs installed and NPM install again at
the saved a flag web pack of service in

0:01:19.160,0:01:22.890
order for webpack's process for dot tag
files that were going to use for Ryan

0:01:22.890,0:01:30.890
we're gonna install a tackler NPM
install saved as tagged loader

0:01:38.550,0:01:43.200
where are they going to install the
battle over again so we're packing

0:01:43.200,0:01:49.570
process or javascript files where we may
choose to use yes six her yes 2015

0:01:49.570,0:02:00.200
syntax babble order has a couple of
dependencies so I'm p.m. in star Jan C

0:02:14.940,0:02:22.190
uses this concept of presets so install
the preset for yes 2015

0:02:26.360,0:02:33.490
and of course we want to set up right so
we're gonna NPM install safe right

0:02:41.620,0:02:44.600
if we look at packaged

0:02:44.600,0:02:49.910
has been installed as a dependency and
web packed with Pakistan server are

0:02:49.910,0:02:56.100
loaders are powerful dependencies have
been installed as dead dependencies so

0:02:56.100,0:02:59.830
we're ready to get moving then next
thing we're going to want to do is

0:02:59.830,0:03:05.910
create our web a configuration file so
in the terminal I just hope that in

0:03:05.910,0:03:17.850
touch where pack that config that chess
open that file up and atom and the first

0:03:17.850,0:03:22.510
thing we're going to do is we're going
to reference newspass mitral

0:03:29.800,0:03:30.800
an asset

0:03:30.800,0:03:35.400
exports to equal an object literal and
the first property we're gonna give that

0:03:35.400,0:03:41.010
objects as entry and that's gonna tell
web back what file to use as our entry

0:03:41.010,0:03:48.380
point so you see here are pointing to
source indexed at Jas and will create

0:03:48.380,0:03:53.290
that file once we're done with the
configuration or second properties

0:03:53.290,0:04:04.390
output and output as an object and
output has a pet property gonna set to

0:04:04.390,0:04:12.810
the current directory name and a
property that we're gonna set to bundle

0:04:12.810,0:04:19.230
Jas and this is going to be the file
name would pack outputs with all of our

0:04:19.230,0:04:22.230
bundle JavaScript

0:04:28.340,0:04:30.500
next we'll create a module

0:04:30.500,0:04:33.500
bernie is also going to be an object

0:04:35.440,0:04:42.540
and their object is going to take a
lawyer's array and each letter is an

0:04:42.540,0:04:50.140
object will start with the Babel order
to create object in the first property

0:04:50.140,0:04:54.270
we're going to give it a test and test
is going to take a red X that's kind of

0:04:54.270,0:05:02.240
point basically tell us which files to
process so in this case we're gonna want

0:05:02.240,0:05:08.320
anything that ends in t.j s second
property is gonna be the loader itself

0:05:08.320,0:05:14.060
as we say hey point anything with a.j s
extension and use the battle over on

0:05:14.060,0:05:18.190
that but we want to make sure that we're
not trying to process everything in the

0:05:18.190,0:05:22.690
note modules directory so we're gonna
pass note modules to the exclusive

0:05:22.690,0:05:29.720
property and babble also has a constant
the presets that we saw we were

0:05:29.720,0:05:35.090
installing or dependencies so we're
gonna pass a query object query object

0:05:35.090,0:05:42.330
is going to take a preset array and
we're going to have that are he has 2015

0:05:46.280,0:05:51.330
and now we need to configure the tag
loader so it's going to follow the same

0:05:51.330,0:05:57.150
pattern so have a test that's what files
to process this case we use anything

0:05:57.150,0:06:06.050
that ends with that tag the letter to
use on those files and that's going to

0:06:06.050,0:06:09.050
be our tag loader

0:06:14.409,0:06:19.399
and we want to make sure we're not
processing the note modules directory so

0:06:19.399,0:06:22.399
I exclude that

0:06:24.300,0:06:25.920
we can see

0:06:25.920,0:06:31.550
and that pretty much handles our
configuration for the setup now we're

0:06:31.550,0:06:35.550
gonna go into package that JSON and
we're gonna set up our scripts so that

0:06:35.550,0:06:41.180
we can run the web packed up sir so take
that placeholder test script that they

0:06:41.180,0:06:45.660
put in there will remain that death or
glory place the content of that with a

0:06:45.660,0:06:55.230
call to web pack that server we can say
that they're gonna create that source

0:06:55.230,0:06:59.900
directory that we pointed to in our web
pack configuration and I'm going to

0:06:59.900,0:07:07.600
create an index JSP file in there that's
going to be our entry point and in the

0:07:07.600,0:07:13.520
root directory I'm also gonna create an
index HTML file and I'm gonna throw a

0:07:13.520,0:07:17.760
basic shelves HTML in there and give
that a title

0:07:23.160,0:07:28.540
and in the body and then had a script
tag that points to fund all that chaos

0:07:28.540,0:07:34.720
and you'll remember that's the output
that we told went back to create our

0:07:34.720,0:07:37.620
source files

0:07:37.620,0:07:41.370
an accredited tags directory inside the
source folder

0:07:42.050,0:07:45.360
this is where we're going to put our
riot tanks so create a new file there

0:07:45.360,0:07:58.960
and just for demonstration purposes will
create a sample output will call sample

0:07:58.960,0:08:07.400
output as a root element will throw in
h1 in there will say hello again right

0:08:07.400,0:08:14.440
jus gotta go back to index HTML and as a
reference to that

0:08:19.190,0:08:21.270
now we need to set

0:08:21.270,0:08:27.200
he's so we can mount that tag to the
page so in indexed at Jas I'm gonna

0:08:27.200,0:08:35.850
create a variable Ryan and I'm gonna
pointed to the riot nude model also

0:08:35.850,0:08:44.390
gonna require my tag file a sign that to
a variable because I don't need to

0:08:44.390,0:08:48.810
reference said through variable I just
need to make sure that the script is

0:08:48.810,0:08:53.360
included on the page when everything
gets bundled together and now added

0:08:53.360,0:08:58.550
document that a defenseless player for
the DOM content cohort event just to

0:08:58.550,0:09:04.000
make sure my pages been fully loaded in
the car back for that i'm gonna call

0:09:04.000,0:09:16.660
right now has a sample output I can say
that back in the terminal I can use that

0:09:16.660,0:09:26.590
and p.m. script that I added earlier by
typing in and him run does well we

0:09:26.590,0:09:32.820
should see that all run through web pack
in a lit up the web packed app server or

0:09:32.820,0:09:38.620
create a bundle and you'll see that it's
processed our index such a ass right Jas

0:09:38.620,0:09:44.180
and our sample output that tag and that
we can see this through localhost 8080

0:09:45.970,0:09:51.019
and you'll see it's serving our page has
bundle their assets and showing us her

0:09:51.019,0:09:55.610
output from Artech not a nice thing
about what pacs dead server is that it

0:09:55.610,0:10:00.839
automatically watches for changes in our
files so if I go into the sample output

0:10:00.839,0:10:09.680
that tank and I make some changes to
paragraph of Lorem Ipsum here say there

0:10:09.680,0:10:15.649
and you'll see that terminal has updated
and I can also go back into my

0:10:15.649,0:10:23.300
javascript and because I'm using the
battler I can use yes yes 2015 a terrace

0:10:23.300,0:10:29.379
index here and I can see if you will see
that it updates the bundle and if I go

0:10:29.379,0:10:33.779
back to the browser and refresh
everything has been updated so we know

0:10:33.779,0:10:40.370
it's working thank you for watching hope
you found this helpful and please check

0:10:40.370,0:10:41.279
