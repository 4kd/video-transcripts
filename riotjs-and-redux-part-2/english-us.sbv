welcome to another installment of the
right chest and redux video series if

0:00:04.680,0:00:08.420
you haven't been following along it will
probably be much easier to start at the

0:00:08.420,0:00:13.650
beginning since each video deals on
where the previous video by staff and

0:00:13.650,0:00:18.080
remember to get up to speed on Redux
itself you really can't beat ya diode

0:00:18.080,0:00:18.740
videos

0:00:18.740,0:00:21.800
paradoxes creator Dan aber muss

0:00:21.800,0:00:27.949
when we left off last time we had
created a redox or created as super

0:00:27.949,0:00:33.640
basic producer and has our story into a
tag so that we can get the state and

0:00:33.640,0:00:38.400
grab properties off of that state object
this time we're going to build on that

0:00:38.400,0:00:42.360
example we're going to introduce some
actions so the first thing I want to do

0:00:42.360,0:00:46.809
is with this sample output tag on it
clean it up and get rid of that excess

0:00:46.809,0:00:51.290
paragraph really need that I know what
I'm going to do isn't gonna add a forum

0:00:51.290,0:00:55.199
is going to add some interactivity I'm
gonna do that and redux

0:00:55.199,0:01:03.039
by dispatching actions so create a forum
for that forms on Submit you want to add

0:01:03.039,0:01:09.410
a change title method and we'll have
that sort a just a moment and my form

0:01:09.410,0:01:14.179
also needs an input will take peace
attacks were gonna call that new title

0:01:14.179,0:01:20.520
and we're gonna give our former button
so that we can submit that new title

0:01:21.530,0:01:26.970
down at the bottom of my tag gonna have
my script tags and I wanna call change

0:01:26.970,0:01:32.229
title and for now just so we can make
sure that everything is wired up and

0:01:32.229,0:01:37.280
everything's been tied to properly
monitor console inside of change title

0:01:37.280,0:01:43.920
and I'm gonna go over my browser and
refresh your notice that I have my

0:01:43.920,0:01:53.679
default title and my new form of tools
escaped a new value into my forum and i

0:01:53.679,0:01:59.729
got a click Change title I should see
the new value logged onto the console so

0:01:59.729,0:02:04.390
now that I know my form is properly
wired up I'm gonna go back into my

0:02:04.390,0:02:09.610
sample output tank to remove that
console log and what I want to do is I

0:02:09.610,0:02:15.260
wanna get access to my store so called
that through this upstart store and I

0:02:15.260,0:02:20.730
want to use the stores dispatch method
to send in and then out to the reducer

0:02:20.730,0:02:27.459
or more appropriately send them action
to the reducer so dispatches gonna send

0:02:27.459,0:02:29.220
an action object

0:02:29.220,0:02:34.240
that object is gonna have a tight
property but I properly as hell we're

0:02:34.240,0:02:40.840
gonna decide what to do with this
particular action and because I'm trying

0:02:40.840,0:02:45.610
to change the title and I have a foreign
value has gone to pass and data along

0:02:45.610,0:02:53.370
with the object so aside from the type
I'm also gonna give it a property and

0:02:53.370,0:03:01.170
can assign the value of new title that
value to the data property now that I

0:03:01.170,0:03:07.600
have that wired up they can go back to
index that Jas and mi reducer I'm gonna

0:03:07.600,0:03:12.540
have to consult with action so we can
see what's happening so got back to my

0:03:12.540,0:03:16.920
browser refresh open up the console
again

0:03:21.050,0:03:28.460
it's a value this is a test into my
title going to submit the form and we'll

0:03:28.460,0:03:33.130
see that we get an object logged out so
the console with the title you have

0:03:33.130,0:03:42.410
changed title signed it in the object we
pass to dispatch and we had a property

0:03:42.410,0:03:47.360
where the value that we tighten to our
employees so we know that our action is

0:03:47.360,0:03:52.470
making it to the reducer for now let's
do something with it so in my producer

0:03:52.470,0:03:58.550
at a switch because 320 handle multiple
actions we want to change our behavior

0:03:58.550,0:04:04.820
based on the types passed in and I want
to add a case may switch for change

0:04:04.820,0:04:12.270
title and because where it is or has to
return to state no matter what must have

0:04:12.270,0:04:18.700
been added to folk case then take my
return state that I had as the only

0:04:18.700,0:04:24.050
functionality in the reducer method and
I'm gonna move that at 200 to fall so

0:04:24.050,0:04:28.370
that if we get an action and we don't
match on the tape will return this state

0:04:28.370,0:04:34.630
as it is and everything will continue to
function so in the change title case I

0:04:34.630,0:04:40.570
want to create a new state and I'm going
to give it a title properly assign

0:04:40.570,0:04:48.030
action that data has the value that
title on our return new state and with

0:04:48.030,0:04:51.030
that in place to go to the browser
refresh

0:04:53.190,0:05:03.350
a forum with my new title I submit the
form it should update the title of my

0:05:03.350,0:05:10.830
tach so just to recap submitting the
form and sample output cause change

0:05:10.830,0:05:16.840
title which uses the Redux stories
dispatch method as long in action object

0:05:16.840,0:05:22.990
their action object has a type and a
piece of data which represents the new

0:05:22.990,0:05:25.780
title

0:05:25.780,0:05:32.010
producer I switch on that action type
when I hit the change table case I

0:05:32.010,0:05:36.540
create a new state sign the title
property of that action that data

0:05:36.540,0:05:42.800
returned that new state and my sample
output eg when it's updated

0:05:43.740,0:05:51.680
called get state again and receive the
new value of title so the problem with

0:05:51.680,0:05:56.520
this new state set up is that this is
gonna raise her in an object that only

0:05:56.520,0:06:02.280
has a title property in a more complex
application for state will contain other

0:06:02.280,0:06:06.130
values that are being used in other
parts of the state tree so you want to

0:06:06.130,0:06:09.880
make sure that we only change the value
were concerned with and still return a

0:06:09.880,0:06:15.130
full version of the state only are
changes reflected so we want to do some

0:06:15.130,0:06:17.270
refactoring

0:06:17.270,0:06:24.160
and I want to use object at a sign and I
want to take the state and an object

0:06:24.160,0:06:29.430
with my new title and won a combined
them into a new object that gets

0:06:29.430,0:06:35.290
returned to represent the new state and
if we go over to the browser we can

0:06:35.290,0:06:49.190
refresh again and get our default title
that we start with value and everything

0:06:49.190,0:06:53.840
I'll continue to wear and that we
verified that we didn't break anything

0:06:53.840,0:06:58.230
or exaggerating we can go back and read
code and remove this console dialogue

0:06:58.230,0:07:03.350
thank you for watching hope you found
this video helpful and be sure to keep

0:07:03.350,0:07:04.980
