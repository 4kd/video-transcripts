# video-transcripts
A collection of transcripts for my training videos to allow the community to make corrections and add translations.

## File Structure

Each video is represented by a folder, named after the video title. Inside the folder, will be a `.sbv` file named for
the language of the translation. In the case of languages with differences by locale, files should be named `language-locale.sbv`,
so `english-us.sbv` and `english-uk.sbv` for example.

The default starting point for each video will be the `.sbv` file that YouTube generates in US English.

## Contributing

To contribute, clone this repo, add your translation or contribute to an existing translation and submit a pull request.

Once your pull request has been merged into the master branch, I will apply the new or updated transcripts to the YouTube videos.

_feel free to contribute to the readme as well_ Whatever is going to help get this information out to the community is welcome.
