hello my name is in Japan sparse and in
this video series we're going to go over

0:00:04.819,0:00:09.190
how you can use the redox library what's
right Jas redux estate management

0:00:09.190,0:00:13.150
library that is gaining a lot of
traction and they react community but

0:00:13.150,0:00:16.080
luckily and is not specifically tied to
react

0:00:16.080,0:00:20.820
we can use it with right chest with
relative ease will cover using redux and

0:00:20.820,0:00:25.529
rights as together here but for much
more detailed look at redux itself you

0:00:25.529,0:00:31.269
can't beat the videos that redux is
creator Dan a remote if you're not

0:00:31.269,0:00:34.809
familiar with right say yes yet you
might want to check out my previous

0:00:34.809,0:00:38.149
videos to get started in this video

0:00:38.860,0:00:44.800
well covered getting redux installed
configuring the Reebok store using the

0:00:44.800,0:00:50.420
story to get state into rage as
components and the videos to follow will

0:00:50.420,0:00:55.719
cover dispatching actions handling those
actions through reducer putting it all

0:00:55.719,0:01:01.250
together to update right based on
actions in other tax let's get started

0:01:01.250,0:01:06.689
with these examples were gonna pick up
where we left off in the riot with

0:01:06.689,0:01:11.250
Westpac introduction in order to use
redux we're gonna need to install that

0:01:11.250,0:01:24.970
module so I'm going to start running an
MPN in scale safe redux and now that we

0:01:24.970,0:01:32.030
have the redox module installed to use
our and p.m. script to run with tax debt

0:01:32.030,0:01:34.360
server

0:01:34.360,0:01:37.360
taking NPM err on death

0:01:42.110,0:01:46.480
we look at the browser and refresh just
to make sure pages still being served by

0:01:46.480,0:01:51.190
text ad server everything checks out so
we're ready to get started

0:01:53.750,0:01:57.370
so it's redux and starred first thing
we're gonna do is we're going to create

0:01:57.370,0:02:03.120
a reference to it in our index JSP file
gonna add bar redux equals require redux

0:02:03.120,0:02:08.660
that's gonna pull the redox library into
our file and now that we have redux

0:02:08.660,0:02:12.560
next thing we need to do is create a
producer function so no adverse producer

0:02:12.560,0:02:17.040
to set it equal function that takes two
arguments the first one its state the

0:02:17.040,0:02:21.959
second one is action producer needs to
always return a state so for now we're

0:02:21.959,0:02:26.280
just gonna turn the state that's past 10
so make no modifications will return in

0:02:26.280,0:02:30.650
new objects just pass it right on
through because we're running web pack

0:02:30.650,0:02:37.700
with Babel we can use a mere six sorry
yes 2015 cent tax so I can set a default

0:02:37.700,0:02:41.900
value to state right inside the
arguments for the function so I said

0:02:41.900,0:02:46.720
that's equal an object and we're gonna
give it a title properly with a default

0:02:46.720,0:02:52.180
value of default title now that we have
the reducer we can use that create a

0:02:52.180,0:02:57.560
store and the store is basically going
to contain our state for application so

0:02:57.560,0:03:04.170
to do that will cause increased or
method on the redox object and more sign

0:03:04.170,0:03:06.799
its value back into redux

0:03:06.799,0:03:11.670
store gonna take my document I add event
listener line I'm just gonna break that

0:03:11.670,0:03:16.160
down into multiple lines that we have
some room to work and I want to take

0:03:16.160,0:03:20.660
this redux store object that I just
created a pass it into my sample output

0:03:20.660,0:03:28.310
tag gonna do that by passing an object
and I'm gonna sign a store property on

0:03:28.310,0:03:34.220
that object the value of redox store now
we're taking that story that redux

0:03:34.220,0:03:39.070
created with a reducer we're passing
into our rights so that we can use it

0:03:39.070,0:03:44.010
now they're passing that in there let's
go into our sample output that tag file

0:03:44.010,0:03:49.239
and make some changes to replace the
title with a call to this dot dot store

0:03:49.239,0:03:53.829
and that's gonna give us that redox
store object that we just passed and and

0:03:53.829,0:03:58.190
the store object has a get state method
on it that allows us to get access to

0:03:58.190,0:04:02.989
the state returning former reducer and
because that state has a title property

0:04:02.989,0:04:04.670
we can call that

0:04:04.670,0:04:10.750
and that should assign the h1 value to
the title that we pass back from her

0:04:10.750,0:04:19.470
state we look at index NJS that is the
value to fall title and since we're

0:04:19.470,0:04:24.370
running backs dead server it's been
rebuilding with each change so we should

0:04:24.370,0:04:28.500
be able to go into a browser refresh and
see this state

0:04:29.070,0:04:34.720
turning that default title value and our
tag is using it just bypassing the story

0:04:34.720,0:04:39.380
in to tack we haven't done anything
super exciting at this point but we have

0:04:39.380,0:04:44.430
laid the groundwork and we know that we
have a Redux or producer and our tags

0:04:44.430,0:04:48.820
all connected wired up properly so next
time we can build on that we can start

0:04:48.820,0:04:53.880
introducing the concept of actions thank
you for watching hope you found this
