welcome to another installment of the
right chest and redux video series if

0:00:04.750,0:00:08.490
you haven't been following along it will
probably be much easier to start at the

0:00:08.490,0:00:12.540
beginning since each video builds on
where the previous video left off

0:00:14.390,0:00:19.230
and remember to get up to speed on Redux
itself you really can't beat ya diode

0:00:19.230,0:00:19.890
videos

0:00:19.890,0:00:23.280
paradoxes creator Dan aber muss

0:00:23.280,0:00:29.200
when we left off last time we had our
right tag dispatching action having a go

0:00:29.200,0:00:32.860
through the reduced her returning in
your state and having that new state

0:00:32.860,0:00:38.540
reflected in our tack one of the key
benefits of a system like redux and the

0:00:38.540,0:00:42.739
fact that our entire application is
represented by a single state tree that

0:00:42.739,0:00:46.190
we have multiple tags communicate with
each other without actually knowing

0:00:46.190,0:00:50.170
about each other as long as they're
aware of the store where the state

0:00:50.170,0:00:55.309
that's being passed into them they can
act independently and user dispatcher to

0:00:55.309,0:01:01.050
get information backup update the state
so we're going to take our existing

0:01:01.050,0:01:05.970
example I'm gonna break it down into
multiple tags performance in its own tag

0:01:05.970,0:01:12.030
it dispatches and action and we make
sure that our output tag still updates

0:01:12.030,0:01:17.320
the title based on that form input so to
get started I'm gonna add a new tags

0:01:17.320,0:01:28.850
gonna call it title forum entitled form
had the route eggs tabled a sworn to

0:01:28.850,0:01:34.439
keep things simple we gotta go to my
sample output headache and I'm gonna cut

0:01:34.439,0:01:37.439
the forum and the associated script tank

0:01:37.939,0:01:47.750
leaving only the title and I'm gonna go
back to my title form tag I'm gonna put

0:01:47.750,0:01:51.920
that for content and the script tag with
the handler entitle form

0:01:52.590,0:01:57.729
gonna go back to index that Jas I'm
gonna have to require to say I have four

0:01:57.729,0:02:03.979
sample output had one for our newsletter
form tank and I'm gonna update my column

0:02:03.979,0:02:09.940
right time and person Astrix that way at
all now and he's had that on the HTML

0:02:09.940,0:02:16.580
file and then I'm going to go into index
HTML I'm gonna horizontal rule just we

0:02:16.580,0:02:22.650
have some kind of visual to show us that
this is new output advertiser form tag

0:02:22.650,0:02:28.930
into the HTML and now you can go over to
my browser and refresh mostly that are

0:02:28.930,0:02:34.620
horizontal rules there and our form is
there but this time it's in its own

0:02:34.620,0:02:42.989
take survey get on the browser and type
in this is my new title and I clicked

0:02:42.989,0:02:49.239
changed will see that nothing happened
so the problem is our stories

0:02:49.239,0:02:53.049
dispatching or action or action is
running through the reduce her at a new

0:02:53.049,0:02:57.720
state is being returned but because the
action is happening in a different tag

0:02:57.720,0:03:03.450
right isn't actually updating the
default title tag I'm sorry the sample

0:03:03.450,0:03:08.670
output eg because it is aware that it
needs to do an update there just to

0:03:08.670,0:03:20.700
prove this let's go to indexed at Jas
and I'm gonna had my console back in the

0:03:20.700,0:03:23.700
browser and refresh

0:03:28.030,0:03:33.720
they've been some new title will see
that our action is still being

0:03:33.720,0:03:41.600
dispatched but we need to make sure that
sample output tag nosed update itself so

0:03:41.600,0:03:49.350
we're gonna get a sample output tang and
I'm gonna add some script tanks and I

0:03:49.350,0:03:53.580
want to access the store that I'm
getting through the options and the

0:03:53.580,0:03:57.720
store as we've seen so far hasn't get
state method that allows us to get

0:03:57.720,0:04:01.930
access to the state and also has the
dispatch method that allows us to pass

0:04:01.930,0:04:09.140
action objects into the reducer and it
has a subscribe method and subscribe

0:04:09.140,0:04:14.670
method is how we're gonna notifier tag
that the state has changed and it needs

0:04:14.670,0:04:19.729
to be updated so subscribers gonna take
it out of its function and in or

0:04:19.729,0:04:25.570
subscribe function we're gonna call
riots this done update and because I'm

0:04:25.570,0:04:31.130
using this inside this anonymous
function I need to make sure I call bind

0:04:31.130,0:04:38.010
with their song that function or to have
a different scope for this and now that

0:04:38.010,0:04:41.010
we have set that up and go back to our
browser

0:04:43.330,0:04:46.979
give it another new title

0:04:48.590,0:04:54.080
this time everything works now we have
an opportunity to do some refactoring so

0:04:54.080,0:04:56.790
we're going to clean up our code a bit
while retaining the exact same

0:04:56.790,0:05:00.750
functionality we have current if we look
at the title form tag will see that our

0:05:00.750,0:05:05.490
dispatches passing this object literal
as our action object this is water

0:05:05.490,0:05:09.960
reducers expecting but there are two
pieces of data and the action object and

0:05:09.960,0:05:13.890
only one that is actually derived from
the event handler and our tag that's the

0:05:13.890,0:05:18.210
value of the input when the form is
submitted the type property is a string

0:05:18.210,0:05:22.390
that is essentially constant value so
we're going to move the creation of this

0:05:22.390,0:05:27.160
object into an action creator reaction
Creator will take the title value as an

0:05:27.160,0:05:32.210
argument and return this object with
that new title value and place your

0:05:32.210,0:05:37.280
order to get that going what we're gonna
do is we're going to add and actions Jas

0:05:37.280,0:05:46.550
file in our source directory and that's
going to export a module so put in

0:05:46.550,0:05:53.110
module that exports will set that equal
an object literal and I wanna give it a

0:05:53.110,0:05:59.380
method called change title and I'm gonna
point change table to a function called

0:05:59.380,0:06:04.900
change diaper change sale is going to
take an argument and that's going to be

0:06:04.900,0:06:12.750
the new title and that's going to return
our action upset so the first thing our

0:06:12.750,0:06:17.150
action object needs are type which is
going to be changed title again using

0:06:17.150,0:06:22.860
exactly what we did from within the tag
or just refactoring the sale that's

0:06:22.860,0:06:27.260
going to have a data property and that's
going to take the new title value and

0:06:27.260,0:06:33.950
pass that along to me I'm going to go
back to my title form tank and I'm gonna

0:06:33.950,0:06:39.529
comment this dispatch call cuz I want to
replace it but I want to keep it as a

0:06:39.529,0:06:48.139
reference to add a new call to stored at
dispatch and this time he's my action

0:06:48.139,0:06:55.769
creator to put the action object and as
dispatches argument in a very do that I

0:06:55.769,0:07:02.399
need to get a reference to my actions
object soyuz require actions that Jas

0:07:02.399,0:07:10.479
and then inside the dispatch function of
has it actions . change title and change

0:07:10.479,0:07:16.199
table takes an argument to represent the
new titles value we can use this start

0:07:16.199,0:07:17.459
new title that value

0:07:17.459,0:07:23.019
let's go to a browser and refresh and
see if everything still works now that

0:07:23.019,0:07:34.119
we've refactored does so I can go into
my changed later function and i cant

0:07:34.119,0:07:40.739
delete a comment about Persian and now
we've refactored to use action creators

0:07:40.739,0:07:41.709
with redux

0:07:41.709,0:07:46.789
thank you for watching hope you found
this video helpful and be sure to keep

0:07:46.789,0:07:48.419
